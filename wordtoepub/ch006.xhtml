        </span>
      </p>
      <p>The journey begins with an exploration of the foundational elements of cloud computing. This section establishes the groundwork, delving into the history and evolution of the cloud. Here, you’ll dive into service models—such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS—distribution methods (public, private, and hybrid), and the essential characteristics of this revolutionary technology. However, this part goes beyond technical aspects: it also examines the regulations that govern cloud adoption, offering an overview of the international laws and guidelines shaping its implementation. Each concept presented serves as a building block, creating a framework to understand the "how" and "why" of the cloud. This is the starting point for anyone seeking orientation in today’s digital landscape.</p>

        <b>A Holistic View of the Chapter</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the end of every chapter, a holistic vision is provided, along with a dialogue produced using ChatGPT 4omni and later refined by the author. A holistic view involves considering a system or phenomenon, rather than focusing solely on individual components. The term "holistic" originates from the Greek word <i>holos</i>, meaning "whole" or "entire."</p>
      <p>Adopting a holistic perspective entail:</p>
